# Data Inspection and Correction Tool

A [web app](https://nosqlcleaner.herokuapp.com/) was developed using Flask. This tool allows a user to inspect and clean/correct data that is to be inserted in a MongoDB or Neo4j database. The primary goal of this tool is to provide an interface with which someone can inspect the values and fields of a document to be inserted in a database and correct any incorrect data as necessary.
